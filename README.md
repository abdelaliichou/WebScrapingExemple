# For building a recommendation system suggesting complementary products based on recent purchases,
#  you can utilize machine learning techniques within the following framework : 

# 1 - Data Preparation:
#         - Data Collection: Gather customer purchase history, including details like customer ID, purchased products, and timestamps.
#         - Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as product categories, common purchases, customer preferences,
#         and frequency of purchases.

# 2 - Model Building:
#     - Collaborative Filtering:
#         - User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommend products based on similar users' purchasing behavior. Identify customers
#         with similar purchase histories.
#         - Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommend products similar to those recently purchased by the customer. Identify
#         products frequently bought together.

#     - Content-Based Filtering:
#         - Analyze product attributes, descriptions, or categories to suggest items with similar characteristics to recent purchases.
#         - Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques if product descriptions or details are available.

#     - Association Rule Mining:
#         - Use algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth to find associations between purchased items and suggest related or complementary
#         products.

#     - Matrix Factorization Techniques:
#         - Apply methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Matrix Factorization to discover latent factors in the purchase
#         history matrix.
# 
# 3 - Model Evaluation and Deployment:
#     - Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
#     - Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like precision, recall, or mean average precision to assess recommendation quality. 
#     - Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize algorithms by tuning parameters to improve performance.
#     - Deployment: Once satisfied with model performance, deploy it in the production environment to provide real-time recommendations.

# 4 - Continuous Improvement:
#     - Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to continuously enhance the recommendation system.
#     - Dynamic Updates: Update the model periodically to adapt to changing customer preferences and trends.
# 
# 5 - Ethics and Privacy:
#     - Privacy Protection: Ensure customer data privacy by anonymizing or securing sensitive information.
#     - Fairness and Transparency: Avoid biases in recommendations and maintain transparency in how suggestions are generated.
#     - By combining these methodologies, you can construct a recommendation system that understands customer preferences, provides
#     accurate suggestions, and evolves with user interactions, enhancing the overall shopping experience.
